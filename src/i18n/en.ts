            p1: "Hello! I’m Ian Axel, an iOS and Full-Stack developer with experience building mobile apps and web solutions. I’m genuinely passionate about technology and how it can be used to solve real problems. ",
            p2: "Today I’m focused on developing iOS applications using Swift, UIKit, and SwiftUI, always looking to apply best practices, clean architectures, and design patterns that improve code quality and the overall user experience. ",

            title: "My Path to iOS",
            p1: "I began my career in mobile development working with Android, using clean architectures with MVVM and design patterns such as Repository, Dependency Injection, Singleton, among others. Later, I decided to expand my horizons and learn hybrid development with React Native. This didn't last long, as due to various circumstances I ended up in web development, where I have trained myself to date, gaining extensive knowledge in frontend and backend. ",
            p2: "Today, I’ve decided to specialize in iOS development, because native mobile has always been my passion. I want Apple’s ecosystem to be the place where I grow professionally and bring all my experience to the creation of high-quality mobile applications. ",

        howIWork: {
            title: "How I Work",
            p1: "I like to plan apps carefully from the beginning, defining a clear and scalable architecture that makes long-term maintenance and evolution easier. I start by understanding the problem, reducing complexity by breaking it into manageable parts and prioritizing the key features. In iOS I’ve worked with patterns like MVVM and Coordinators, applying Clean Architecture principles and combining them with Combine and async/await, alongside Alamofire. The goal is always the same: clean, modular, testable code and well-defined navigation and data flows. ",
            p2: "I come from a full-stack background, so I’m used to working closely with the backend: understanding how APIs work, reviewing API contracts, proposing changes to improve them, and thinking about performance end to end. ",
            p3: "Beyond the code itself, I value effective communication, feedback, and teamwork. I believe a good developer doesn’t just write code, but also understands the business rules and knows how to collaborate with everyone involved — designers, product owners, other developers, and more — with the shared goal of creating solutions that truly deliver value. ",

        beyondCode: {
            title: "Beyond the Code",
            p1: "When I’m not coding, I usually spend my time learning new technologies or exploring personal projects. I enjoy reading and watching content about software development, software architecture, design patterns, and new tools that can improve my workflow — and I try to bring many of those ideas into my projects or evaluate them as potential new products with an innovative twist. ",
            p2: "I also enjoy activities outside tech, like sports, video games, and music. These days I really like training at the gym and playing soccer with my team on weekends — it helps me clear my mind and stay disciplined in my daily routine. ",
            p3: "Another important part of my life is watching sports, especially baseball. Lately I’ve become a big fan of the sport, particularly of Diablos Rojos del México. It’s a very strategic game that keeps me engaged, and I’m always learning something new because the rules are so rich and detailed.",
            p4: "Finally, a recently adopted activity is hiking, which has allowed me to clear my mind, appreciate the beauty of nature, and stay physically active. I climbed a mountain called 'La Malinche' in Tlaxcala, Mexico, and it was an incredible experience that motivated me to explore more hiking trails in the future. ",

            excerpt: "This recent article summarizes trends in the iOS community, such as the evolution of architectural patterns in SwiftUI. For example, it questions the extensive use of MVVM in each view, pointing out that it can add unnecessary complexity; instead, SwiftUI allows services to be injected globally via @Environment to avoid redundant ViewModels and keep views simpler.
